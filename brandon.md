<p>Hello, I’m Brandon! I was born and raised in San Francisco, where the Northern California tide pools and trails imprinted me with a crunchy conservationist disposition.
<br> <br>
I established the _notes_ with the other founding editors while studying medicine and theology in Philadelphia. While I do take pleasure in writing, I much prefer curating texts, especially from any author with a powerfully consistent ethos; recently, I’ve even learned to see “post physique” as a legitimate request (though not required for all submissions). I studied religion at Princeton and enjoy acoustic guitar, martial arts, and oolong tea.
<br> <br>
My editorial subject areas include but aren’t limited to theology, natural and medical sciences, human behavior, and style. Some of my formal research interests are moral emotions, neuropsychology of virtue, theological ethics, and primary care in underserved communities.
