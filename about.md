>“Beauty has been stolen from the people and is being sold back to them under the concept of luxury!" Kanye West, Oxford Lecture 2015

Resonant notes is a twice-yearly commentary drawing contributions from lovers of the arts and natural sciences. The journal finds meaning and symbolism in each discipline and brings their stories to bear on contemporary events. We are particularly devoted to beauty, in all of its fun, practical, or transcendent appearances, as the primary expression and vehicle for goodness and truth in a post-Christian milieu.

Our articles are those we’d like to share with our family members, and we hope you’ll share them with yours!

Accepted pieces appear in online publication, and we compile them into a periodical... periodically. Each print issue is available for purchase upon request. Our writing is intended to be useful or entertaining to the Church and people of good will. Thus, while Christian-inflected writing is certainly welcome, submissions need not be explicitly religious. Topics range from _to be discussed_.
