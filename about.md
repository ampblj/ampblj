>“Beauty has been stolen from the people and is being sold back to them under the concept of luxury!" Kanye West, Oxford Lecture 2015

Resonant Notes is a twice-yearly commentary that seeks meaning and symbolism across disciplines. We are particularly devoted to beauty as a vehicle for goodness and truth in a post-Christian milieu.

Our articles are those we’d like to share with our family members, and we hope you’ll share them with yours!

Accepted pieces appear in online publication, and we compile them at the end of each period into an issue of the journal. Each print issue is available for purchase upon request. Our writing is intended to be useful or entertaining to the Church and people of good will. Thus, while Christian-inflected writing is certainly welcome, submissions need not be explicitly religious. Topics range from _to be discussed_.
