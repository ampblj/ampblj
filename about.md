>Beauty has been stolen from the people and is being sold back to them under the concept of luxury!<br>
Kanye West, Oxford Lecture 2015

_Resonant notes_ is a twice-yearly commentary drawing contributions from lovers of the arts and natural sciences. Our periodical finds meaning and symbolism in each discipline and mobilizes them for life-affirming and counterrevolutionary strategy. We are particularly devoted to beauty, in all of its fun, practical, or transcendent appearances, as the primary expression and vehicle for goodness and truth in a post-Christian milieu. 
<br> <br>
Our articles are those we’d like to share with our friends and family members, and we hope you’ll share them with yours!
<br> <br>
Accepted pieces appear in online publication, and we compile them into a periodical... periodically. Each print issue is available for purchase upon request. Our writing is intended to be useful or entertaining to the Church and people of good will. Thus, while Christian-inflected writing is certainly welcome, submissions need not be explicitly religious.
<br> <br>

<h3>Submission guidelines</h3>

We welcome submissions and appreciate your interest in Resonant notes! Feel free to send inquiries or manuscripts to the editor whose interests you think best encompass your submission, or use this [form](https://forms.gle/nKap4ZrARxYwJxti7). We occasionally accept autobiographical narratives and short fiction in addition to our main sections.
<br> <br>
Accepted submissions may be of any length, and we may publish accepted pieces in later issues if there are already many other articles of similar length or category, or depending on the theme. To encourage creativity and avoid subjecting authors’ voices to editors’ whims, we first decide whether to accept a submission for publication before recommending edits or revisions. The only required changes are for formatting.
<br> <br>
We encourage authors to send a photograph or drawing to accompany their piece before or after acceptance of a submission. Editors will otherwise select an image to represent your piece.
