<p>Hi, I'm Ammar. First and foremost, I'm a follower of Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church. 
<br><br>
I work as the Chief of Staff at the <a href="https://www.adcompsystems.com/">AdComp Systems Group</a>, a city government tech company in Dallas, my hometown. The company was founded by my father, and I hope to help him continue to build it. 
<br><br>
My educational background is in economics, philosophy, and neuroscience. I attended St. Mark's School of Texas for high school and completed both my undergraduate and graduate degrees at the University of Pennsylvania. 
<br><br>
I currently serve as the Managing Director of the <a href="https://www.collegiuminstitute.org/philosophy-of-finance">Collegium Institute's Philosophy of Finance</a> seminar.
