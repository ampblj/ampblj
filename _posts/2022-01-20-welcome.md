Intrepid reader, welcome to the first compilation of _Resonant notes_! Just as friends brim with news to share after long times apart, so we have much we would say to you about our joy in this project. The _notes_ are, like many other publications, the result of friendship. It’s a blessing for friends to share writing with one another and for friends’ families to read what we might share with our own families.

Our vision of a familial exchange of ideas expanded once we considered some unmet opportunities in the larger Church and society. It’s certainly enjoyable to produce and read thoughtful writing without seeking approval from an elite base. Further, there aren’t many publications to our knowledge that artistically, humorously, and sometimes aggressively express truth and goodness for a recognizably post-Christian milieu. The _notes_ will make space for necessary offense while refraining from being _too_ obnoxious for the sake of obnoxiousness. Relative to the witness of the Church, the West has entered what Aaron Renn has called the “negative world.” In this environment, Christianity has become socially and economically costly, which stands opposed to its artistic recognition and cultural esteem of years past. Yet, many publications attempt to retain influence by speaking the language of culturally powerful contemporary institutions that ultimately reject truth.

We’re therefore glad for the opportunity to offer a distinct witness for all people of good will. We recognize that beauty, already worthy of celebration, is today the primary way truth and goodness disclose themselves. Thus, our name calls on the concept of “resonance” that writers such as Maximus the Confessor and Hans Urs von Balthasar developed. Much like a musical note activating an object’s natural frequency (think wine glasses or tuning forks), the resonance of beauty is a moment of divine insight that draws out meaning in nature. 

As a collection of notes, our publication style will be a bit unconventional. You can call us a journal if you like, though we’ve chosen to avoid the description since it connotes the myopia of contemporary academia. Revitalizing and developing our traditions will need room for creativity! To that end (and in solidarity with every Christian pub that quotes a favorite trilogy), we hope the _notes_ will prove fertile ground for organic seeds of thought, for we “all share a love for things that grow.”

Thanks for beginning this journey with us, and may it bring many smiles to all we love. _SDG_.
