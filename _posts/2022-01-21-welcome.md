<h3>Bonus: some other names we considered.</h3>

<pre>
<s>Second things</s>
 
<s>Third digit</s>
 
<s>Costly signal</s>
</pre>

This refers to the phenomenon wherein an animal demonstrates fitness to potential mates through costly displays that signal abundance (ex. colorful peacock tails). Analagously, curating a publication is a costly signal, which we silly fellows found clever/funny. We nixed this because it's probably not that funny.

<s>Ambiguum</s>

No foreign languages. We're trying not to sound like the archetypal Catholic philosophy journal.

<s>Holy fool</s>

Sounds like _Motley Fool_. Also, we're not fools (we are, but we don't want you to know that). We are certainly not holy. Yet.

<s>Activated charcoal</s>

Just no.

<s>Unmixed/unconfused</s>

Too angsty. Also, it sounds like Kendrick Lamar's _untitled unmastered_.

<s>Not your grandfather's journal</s>

Too reminiscent of BLM's cringe manifesto. Also, if my grandchildren ever read this, they will be confused.
