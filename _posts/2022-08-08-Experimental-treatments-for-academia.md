I am a relatively young scholar working across disciplines, and I’m often surprised when asked to take academic consulting roles. The projects for which I consult, from designing a clinic with a health design lab to developing curriculum for a theology department, keep me parallel to academia without being reliant on its incentive structures. I also lead seminars for Philadelphia’s Collegium Institute, which aims to revitalize the modern academy using the Catholic intellectual tradition. Since my near-term work will be mostly clinical rather than academic, I can enjoy an observer’s perspective on movements that will affect the next generations of scholarship.

Recently, I stopped by Duke as part of a project on Christian education. The train ride from Philly to Durham gave me ample time to ponder some news that had just been released before my trip: Jordan Peterson, clinical psychologist-turned-public intellectual and “internet dad” to many, had made an [announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKbqhG8eWm4) to YouTube and his over five million subscribers. He would be the new chancellor of Ralston College, an educational venture dedicated to free inquiry that will welcome its first cohort for an MA in the humanities this fall. Regardless of one’s personal opinions of Peterson, [Ralston](https://www.ralston.ac/about), based in Savannah, Georgia, is an experiment in humanistic education that will be worth tracking.

The idea for Ralston began in the 2000s as a way to create the “educational institutions on which a free and flourishing human culture depends.” Included in this revival of humanistic inquiry were principles of freedom from political or religious affiliation and an absolute commitment to free speech. Around 2019-20, the school assembled its faculty and staff, curated podcasts and lectures, and gained degree-granting abilities. I first learned of them a year before Peterson’s announcement when I watched an interview they had with the late Sir Roger Scruton, and I have since been a curious onlooker. At Duke, I asked the opinion of one academic, who for the last decade has been actively promoting academic freedom and reviving the art of Socratic dialogue. His response to the question of what he thought of the new MA at Ralston was, “I hadn’t heard of it before, but I wish I were asked to work there. I’d love to!” If alerted to new projects, he and other reform-minded traditionalists can now direct their enthusiasm with the aid of technology.

Ralston’s initiative is a case study for how other reformers might organize new modes of teaching that can serve diverse goals, from educating for Christian community to discovering compelling philosophers in the 21st century. A lean and heavy-hitting faculty (I counted twelve full-time faculty on their website) and beginning with graduate-exclusive study are a rare combination allowing rapid and observable iterative solutions. The goals of classical liberal initiatives like Ralston and those of Christian educators of course differ, but the groups face many of the same challenges and may learn from each others’ strategies. With the changing relationships of [Christianity to the West](https://www.firstthings.com/article/2022/02/the-three-worlds-of-evangelicalism) and the West to its own intellectual tradition, these strategies will be important for reimagining higher education in an era when trust in elite universities is fading. 

Several variables are relevant for reformist educators who value tradition, including fostering online constituencies, organizing around a few excellent scholars, and small cohorts of motivated students:

**Tasteful online outreach**

> The first of these variables combines outreach efficiency with a tastefulness rarely found in online-only conservative outlets. Those who are skilled teacher-communicators, or just excellent scholars with a good production team, should produce online materials that are manifestly rigorous and insightful. If these inspire some learners to take learning to another level and continue dialogue through face-to-face interactions, this strategy could combine the best of online and offline settings. Peterson’s lectures on topics such as psychology in the Bible and personality have reached millions, while institutions such as Hillsdale College offer online lecture series, e.g. on Biblical literature, garnering hundreds of thousands of subscribers. While some of these videos have excellent production quality, many are simple recordings of classroom lectures, so the most important features are compelling arguments and an enthusiastic teacher. If only one percent of those who watched Peterson’s announcement apply to Ralston’s MA program, the school has an excellent chance of filling its twenty spots with highly capable students from among well over a thousand applicants. These students would already be highly motivated with an affinity for the school’s ethos developed from prior online engagement. 

> Few traditionally-minded educators blend popular and academic material online in a way that translates to in-person enrollment, which may reflect a generational gap in awareness of what is effective to reach younger Millennials and Gen Z’ers. Thus, reformers who can use these formats are at an ideal transition point. Many academics with degrees or teaching positions from prestigious universities see the major universities as failing, but they still have institutional memory of what worked from these places in times past. Drawing from that knowledge, their existing networks, and their areas of expertise, they can use a medium such as online forums or lectures to find new students and bring the best of the university to new forms.

**Academic crack team**

> A reforming venture needs only a few excellent educators, preferably those who have long experience or some publications. While a highly visible figure or good online presence can help build a large following, most of the in-person teaching as well as background work for public engagement, e.g. curriculum development, requires people devoted primarily to scholarship. Potential students will know the school from only a few topics that are well-presented, so scholars should gather around one or two themes that can serve the role of majors or disciplines.

> These scholars should continue to research and write while developing a base of supporters and donors, as they will desire freedom from state and federal funding. Coming from industry or academic positions, they could continue their work with excellence while furthering their venture as a passionate project on the side. This project likely includes pursuing the necessary if mostly perfunctory milestones of accreditation. In the case of Ralston and perhaps future endeavors, the level of instructors—including Oxbridge professors and Stephen Wolfram of math and computer science fame—is high enough that accreditation is mostly a formality for logistical purposes and students’ professional options. Thus, new educational ventures should pursue the simplest route for degree-granting privileges or accreditation with the state or any of the nongovernmental agencies approved by the U.S. Department of Education. Once degree-granting ability has been attained and enough interest has developed around variable 1, an online presence, the time will be right for the new organization and its scholars to publicize a degree program to the greater public. Organizations such as think tanks already have a head start in gathering scholars, and these could also shift a group of their staff to developing a small degree program, especially at the graduate level.

**Tight student cohort**

> The most important variable to watch will be the student cohort a program like Ralston’s attracts. Like the educators, these students would be searching for things currently missing from the academy. They will select a place for its differentiated first principles, which in Ralston’s case are its commitments to free inquiry and open discussion. Hopefully, matriculants will receive professional benefits comparable to those at elite universities.

> While many elite universities retain quantifiable value for STEM in terms of research outputs and technical skills conferred, their advantages over other institutions have dwindled to a few for budding humanists. Students at the Ivies and other elite schools have access to the excellent networks afforded by places with long history and scale. They can have the ineffable and “enviable distinction” of being a “Harvard man,” in JFK’s college application words, or a “Princeton” or “Yale man”, etc., molded into a particular type of person with the school’s imprint. Finally, students can potentially receive, through great struggle, a mostly self-curated excellent liberal education.

> Hopefully students will see education itself, for the good, true, and beautiful, as the main benefit of attending a reform-minded institution. Besides this, a smaller cohort with close student-professor relationships will retain some strengths of elite institutions, so long as teachers see themselves as necessary for their students’ advancement in these areas. It will be incumbent on teachers to become professional mentors who open networking opportunities to their students. As students will be in constructive dialogue with the Great Books tradition, they can avail themselves of the mentorship models within that tradition such as tutorials or relationships akin to apprenticeships. They might be formed less by a general idea of an elite university and more by engagement with primary texts and their teachers, whose closer discussions with students will leave a unique imprint. A tight residential cohort can provide more experiences in common, creating close colleagues and dear friends for life.

Those forming Christian scholars and humanists have much to learn from each other. Some may want to stay small to safeguard integrity while others may want to grow to improve accessibility and public impact. They might compare notes with medicine, which alongside academia has been beset by mission drift, administrative overreach, and runaway costs. Gathering smaller groups of educators as academic guerrillas, thereby cutting out excess bureaucracy, has many similarities with independent physicians practicing Direct Primary Care, which interested me while I was researching my own options. Other potential issues, such as ensuring ongoing financial viability or avoiding cults of personality, will also have to be worked out iteratively in these small teaching settings.

These lessons from Ralston will serve one part of a treatment to revitalize academia amid the post-Christian milieu, and I wish them much success. I also hope other new case studies may be added to this one. Perhaps some may be so bold as to base themselves in the special resources of the Christian faith and be led by the Spirit, the principle of any renewal. Facing a decline of trust in institutions and a need for radical change in education, the fun of experimentation now awaits.
