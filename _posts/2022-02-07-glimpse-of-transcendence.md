Picture yourself in the late 12th-century, at a tiny village called Kurbinovo in present-day North Macedonia. As you leisurely stroll along a nearby stream, you encounter a modest, iconic church named after St. George.

Its external appearance is rather humble and ordinary, with an atmosphere not unlike a quaint vacation home. It has little architectural fanciness or structural diversity (Fig. 1), at least compared to other churches like St. Peter’s in Rome.

But once you enter, it becomes a whole new world. 

Frescoes narrating Christ’s earthly ministry and Passion completely surround your field of vision. You immediately encounter the risen Jesus and His marveling disciples above the apse, beckoning you to enter into worship (Fig. 3). As you move towards the center of the nave, you can’t help but notice that every inch of space proclaims Christ’s marvelous works of salvation; in fact, each wall of the church is completely filled with icons of the Divine Lord (Fig. 4). Realistic yet sublime, these Byzantine masterpieces transport your soul back to the first century, where you share with the first witnesses the experience of ultimate awe and wonder. Your only response is to be overwhelmed by the Savior, bowing in both fear and adoration—just in time for the Divine Liturgy to begin.

Of course, such transcendental power in Christian art didn’t begin in Kurbinovo. Throughout history, churches have cared a lot about its presentation, both in their architecture and art. But it wasn’t just for show; their designs were often far too intentional, intricate, and even alluring for such trivial purposes. They served a deeper role, one that acknowledged a central function of the visible church---where God’s people enjoy God’s presence---while recognizing the power of beauty in fueling that journey. One need only to look at God’s thorough care towards His original tabernacle, which [the church ultimately fulfills](https://drjimsebt.com/2020/12/30/the-church-fulfills-and-replaces-old-testament-temple/), to see these elements at play. It’s no wonder that some of the first individuals whom the Holy Spirit fills are the artists and craftsmen for that glorious structure (Exodus 31).

In the current “[negative world](https://americanreformer.org/welcome-to-the-negative-world-why-we-need-american-reformer/),” our society actively combats Christian morals and the faith as a whole. We seem to clash on virtually every front---from views on sexuality to (Biblical) history to even anthropology. And of course, Christians ought to fight back against the corrupt “wisdom of men” and stand for all that is pure and righteous in God’s eyes. 

At the same time, we’d be remiss to discount one common ground that we do share: a striving for the transcendent. With [over a quarter of the US population identifying as “spiritual but not religious](https://www.newsweek.com/americans-who-identify-no-religion-now-account-29-percent-population-poll-1659344),” the negative world still has a growing appetite to experience the other-worldly. Sadly, they’ve turned not towards the Creator of transcendence, but to mere shadows and illusions. It’s likely why so many flock to virtual reality ([over 57 million users in the US in 2020!](https://techjury.net/blog/virtual-reality-statistics/#gref)), and why Mark Zuckerberg put all his eggs in the Metaverse basket: because [escapism is tempting](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/10/facebook-metaverse-name-change/620449/), and an other-worldly escapism that promises omnipotence is infinitely more tempting. 

For Christians, such hunger only confirms our faith in a transcendent reality. As C.S. Lewis remarked in _The Weight of Glory_, “Surely a man’s hunger does prove that he comes of a race which repairs its body by eating and inhabits a world where eatable substances exist.” But in light of that trend in the broader culture, we must live up to our titles as _ambassadors_, in bringing a glimpse of our heavenly home to a wanting world that prays “to the unknown god” (Acts 17:23). We must convey the beauty of not just God’s word, but also His presence---like a warrior wielding both his shield and sword. It’s precisely here that the arts can pave a way - as God intended in the Tabernacle, and faithful artists emulated in Kurbinovo. A picture can be worth a thousand words.

And of course, the arts need not be limited to depictions; one can easily note past and present examples through music, performance, and so on. To highlight one instance, St. Andrew’s Chapel in Florida (where R.C. Sproul pastored) [chose the architectural route](https://sachapel.com/about/who-we-are/our-place-worship.html): 

“The architectural design of the sanctuary is in accordance with the traditional cruciform pattern. Worshipers enter through the darkness of the narthex and into the light of the sanctuary radiating from the stained glass windows adorning the chancel and sanctuary. This is a reminder that when we come to worship in the sanctuary, we cross the threshold of the secular to the sacred, from the common to the uncommon, from the profane to the holy, from darkness to light.”

As [Sproul himself summarized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjul5GM9HZ0), the design is “an architectural manifestation of the law and the gospel itself.” 

Regardless of the medium, the arts have a way of inviting their audience into an _experience_ uncapturable with words alone. They can overwhelm the senses---as the Scriptures can do to the mind, and prayer to the heart---and stir up a zeal for the heavenly. For the church, that can be a much-needed antidote against modernity’s attempts at self-definition and self-sufficiency. Dwelling visually on the crucifixion or physically walking from darkness into light can be potent reminders to the secular age that living solely for oneself will never quench this eternal hunger. The world may reject the morality of our faith, but it still longs for the transcendence in our faith.

Yet God’s church cannot wield this weapon in man-centered or man-made ways, for art is only as powerful as the experience it evokes. Even the intricate Tabernacle only “serve[d] a copy and shadow of the heavenly things” (Heb. 8:5); all its elaborate architecture, art and artifacts drew their significance solely from the “heavenly” realities that were signified and elicited to their recipients. So if the experience evoked is only aimed to please the eyes of the world---as may be the temptation for “seeker-friendly” churches---it fails to apply the medium’s full potential. “For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified.” (1 Cor. 1:22-23a)

This is all the more reason why a church that disregards the transcendental, or stoops down to the world’s conception of it, will do a great disservice for both its members and the watching world; and a church not living up to the Spirit-revealed transcendence of our faith will struggle to feed its members’ hunger for it. Again, Lewis is spot on: “If Christianity could tell me no more of the far-off land than my own temperament led me to surmise already, then Christianity would be no higher than myself.”

Instead, we must follow the artists in Exodus 31, who utilized their Spirit-given talents to construct the Tabernacle faithfully as God designed. The calling for Christian craftsmen and cultivators, to unveil God’s glory through the church to the wanting world, is just as grand today as it was back then. But this mission applies not just to vocational artists and musicians; every member of Christ’s body has a part to play in its adornment, for it to fully become the channel through which God’s glory is displayed and experienced. 

But just as importantly, even our personal lives---our homes, hearts, and habits---must be refined to reflect the transcendent reality that we actually partake in; for we are all temples of the living God. When we engage in Kingdom ethics that transcend worldly reasoning, we show the world that a greater worldview exists. When we exude Kingdom joy even in the most arduous circumstances, we demonstrate that a greater experience is possible. And when we embody our Kingdom citizenship as exiles in this world, we prove that a greater reality awaits. This way, we the church can follow Jesus in proclaiming: “Behold, something greater than [the Metaverse] is here.” (Mt. 12:42)
