This interview helped facilitate my conversion. I realized that I could only come to know God if I first adopted a paradigm through which others know God. This idea is related to the [theory-ladenness of observation](https://www.rit.edu/cla/philosophy/quine/theory_ladenness.html).

Described by a cultural critic friend as “abomination” and “not music,” this is nevertheless an eye-opening exposition of the father-spirit archetype in Genesis and human attachment. See Carl Jung’s _Two Essays on Analytical Psychology_ and _The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious_ for more background.

Why I like this vid:
1. This guy is a leader in the right to repair movement, which is based in property rights, a foundation that we often overlook. 
2. He doesn’t blame others but epitomizes the idea of taking responsibility for mistakes that he makes and controlling what he can control.
3. Here he essentially explains why we need to have Aristotelian categories of friendship.
