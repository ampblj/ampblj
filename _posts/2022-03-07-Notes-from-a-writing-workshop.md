This past weekend, Brandon and I attended a writing workshop sponsored by the Scala Foundation at the Witherspoon Institute in Princeton, NJ. The workshop was led by William Gonch ([https://scalafoundation.org/people/william-gonch/](https://scalafoundation.org/people/william-gonch/)).

I have jotted some notes about the experience.

- The format
    - We start with introductions---name, what we do, and what we will be working on.
    - We write (loosely) for about an hour and a half.
    - We share
        - what we were working on
        - solicit ideas about challenging aspects of the piece
        - declare a goal for next month
- What makes the format good?
    - In theory, it’s intervocational; you can participate while working on something of any format—essay, presentation, reading, email, business plan.
    - It’s social. People working on very different things can converse about the things they’re working on.
    - Creates an external commitment via a timed working atmosphere.
    - There’s a built-in break. After the working session, people must discuss and can incorporate some movement while departing the venue.
    - Fresh ideas. Because other attendees are likely working on entirely different things, they can supply out-of-the-box thinking and opportunities for synthesis.
- Ideas from the workshop
    - Why do publications have fixed written formats?
        - For example, a magazine accepts submissions with a specific word count range and of a particular type: book reviews, short stories, meta-analyses, op-eds.
        - Reason 1: readers know what they’re getting into so that they can more assuredly commit themselves to reading it.
        - Reason 2: it provides the author with a constraint, around which the author is free to develop his/her ideas.
    - What is useful about defining a “literary type”?
        - Ex. a workshop participant was interested in writing a story about the lurking environmental threat that faces humanity.
        - A workshop participant characterized this as the archetypal “monster-in-a-box” story—similar to the movie *Alien*.
        - Another participant noted that *Crime and Punishment* could also be seen as a “monster-in-a-box” story, Raskolnikov’s conscience being the inescapable monster.
        - I soon realized that every story with an intractable problem could be categorized as an archetypal “monster-in-a-box” story, so the only value in identifying such a literary type is to prime the author in a particular way (play up scariness or the sense of confinement).
- What I got out of the experience
    - I got a lot of reading done. The topic I am writing on is vignettes as a survey methodology.
    - I intend to convene a writing workshop like this on the occasional Saturday.
    - Given the apparent value of having fixed written formats, Brandon and I were able to come up with the few for *Resonant notes* including the obvious “notes” format of which this post is a prototype. Some others we came up with will trickle in. Stay tuned.
