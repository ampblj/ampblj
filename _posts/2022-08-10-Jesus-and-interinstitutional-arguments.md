Matthew and Luke reflect different strands of criticism of the Pharisees, one drawing on arguments that would have been shared by priests and the Qumran community and one stemming from more typically “prophetic” stances promoting justice. In Matthew, Jesus employs arguments that may have been familiar to lawyers and priests as he demonstrates the absurdity of the Pharisees’ theological leadership. Meanwhile, in Luke, Jesus shows himself to be the culmination of a dissident prophetic tradition. In both Gospels, Jesus demonstrates a synthesis of different forms of theological leadership, e.g. legal and prophetic, and employs a series of strategies for calling people to repentance while effectively rebuking those with institutional power. This approach, presenting denunciations as inter-institutional critiques, may be a shrewd way to divide Jesus’s detractors. In these narratives, the strategy helps Jesus to postpone the strong resistance he will face against his teachings, especially many of the more radical ones such as his resurrection or the destruction of the Temple.

The Pharisees, who were the first century precursors to Rabbinic Judaism, were in an embattled position at the time of the Gospel writers. They occupied a role more closely attached to popular piety than to the leadership of the Temple and sought to make the teaching and observance of the Law (the Torah and commentaries attached to it) more accessible to common people by teaching in synagogues. The Pharisees competed with other sects that envisioned different relationships between the Law, Temple, and the people and therefore had competing theological visions, as the Law and Temple mediated the ways the people worshiped God. Sadducees and priests not affiliated with the Pharisees resisted a decentralized vision of worship and criticized what they saw as distracting additions to the Law. Pharisees also faced criticism from the Essenes, associated with the Qumran community (those who collected the Dead Sea Scrolls), and from prophetic figures such as John the Baptist (Matthew 3:7). Drawing from these competing traditions, Yair Furstenberg’s article “Jesus against the Laws of the Pharisees” demonstrates how Matthew converses using modes of rhetoric common to these different sects. Furstenberg’s contextualization of Jesus’s “woe” sayings is helpful for seeing how Jesus speaks through and across the competing traditions. Jesus demonstrates facility with and judgment over these sects as he points to himself as the fulfillment of their common hopes.

The woe sayings of Matthew 23 and Luke 11:37-54 are both aimed at the Pharisees, among others in the leadership classes, but have some fundamental differences in audience and scope that play out in their literary forms. Furstenberg maintains the view that Luke prioritizes moral obligations over ritual practice while Matthew points towards the inability of the Pharisees to fulfill the Law. The differences in approach may derive from Luke’s emphasis on modes of discourse more associated with the prophets, while Furstenberg sees Matthew as drawing from roughly contemporary criticisms of the Pharisees that use a legal perspective.

The settings themselves support an identification of Luke’s woe sayings with prophets and Matthew’s with legal argument. Luke presents the woes within a narrative of a meal, in which a Pharisee invites Jesus to dine with him and Jesus does not “observe the prescribed washing before the meal” (11:38 NAB). The action (or inaction) of Jesus evokes a reaction of amazement from the Pharisee, functioning similarly to the signs that prophets use. The discourse follows a common pattern in which the prophet presents a strange action—here not washing before eating—that prompts surprise and a question of the meaning of the action, and this question in turn leads to the prophet pronouncing a judgment on the questioner (e.g. Ezekiel 24, Jeremiah 19-20). Further, Luke shows Jesus speaking the judgment directly to the wielders of institutional power, the Pharisees, which fits the literary pattern of the prophets presenting God’s word to the rulers in a direct confrontation often unmediated by the people, at least narratively.

Matthew, in contrast, presents the denunciations of the Pharisees in the setting of a discourse to the crowds and disciples. The crowds may serve the role of witnesses to a legal dispute with the Pharisees and scribes who have assumed their “seat on the chair of Moses” (Matthew 23:2). Moving on from the setting, the content of the woes in Matthew share similarities with the legal criticisms of Pharisees’ rituals by the Sadducees, as preserved in the Mishnah, and the Essenes, preserved in documents such as the Halakhic Letter 4QMMT in the Dead Sea Scrolls. 

Matthew has Jesus criticizing the internal consistency of the Pharisees, since they “tie up heavy burdens…on people’s shoulders” but “will not lift a finger to move them” (Matthew 23:4). Jesus makes what appears to be an argument about the internal and legal logic of the Pharisees’ teaching on oaths (23:16-22) which is later delineated in the Mishnah’s exacting distinctions between the altar and Temple versus things that human beings can personally consecrate, such as gold and offerings. In verse 23, Jesus condemns the Pharisees for following the law on small matters, e.g. tithing herbs, and neglecting the weighty things of justice, mercy, and faithfulness. Pesher on the Psalms and Pesher Nahum, two of the Qumran community’s commentary on the writings and prophets, also charge Pharisees and religious leaders with observing lighter instead of weightier teachings and “teaching smooth things,” making the charge more in reference to inadequate standards of sacrifice and Temple worship. The Qumran community pointed out that the blind entering the Temple could not distinguish between clean and unclean in everyday life and might defile the Temple, whereas Jesus calls the Pharisees blind guides who are unable to distinguish the clean and unclean and therefore demonstrate their unawareness of what is truly holy. 

Furthermore, Jesus connects a denunciation of the moral status of the Pharisees with an argument about cleansing the inside and outside of vessels. The priests’ and sages’ arguments over the requirements and ordering of which parts of vessels to clean later appear in rabbinic documents, the Mishnah and Tosefta. These arguments become a way for Jesus to illustrate that the concern for purity should inevitably produce conflict within a person who is living unrighteously yet concerned for the finer points of the Law. “Inside they are full of plunder and self-indulgence. Blind Pharisees, cleanse first the inside of the cup, so that the outside also may be clean” (23:25-26). The righteousness of followers of Jesus must exceed that of the Pharisees through purity of heart that then allows sanctified action.

This is not to say that the Matthean legal aspects are only comprehensible to the writer’s contemporary Jews or that Lukan prophetic ways of speaking are necessarily more appealing to Gentiles, i.e. the traditional audiences of each author. Nor is it true that Luke’s depiction of Jesus is wholly prophetic, or that Matthew’s is primarily priestly (or that Mark’s depiction is primarily that of a king, even when considering the politically subversive opening verse). None of the Gospels has a monopoly on any of these particular themes. For example, we should note that Luke does have Jesus engaged in discussions and activities that draw from knowledge of a legal tradition. From the first sections of Luke’s narrative, the circumcision and presentation of Jesus in the temple are based on legal requirements for Jewish sons. The search for Jesus in the temple finds him precociously disputing with the teachers of the Law.

The Gospels do appear to present each theme of prophecy and Law in a different way stylistically. Matthew in the woes discourse explicitly brings up the prophets at the end (23:35-39), while prophetic style and language constitute Luke’s discourse throughout. Both end with charging the scribes and Pharisees with the blood of the righteous from Abel to Zechariah. Further, Luke highlights Jesus as the consummate prophet who establishes God’s justice in chapter 4, when Jesus opens the scroll of Isaiah in the Nazareth synagogue, proclaims the “year acceptable to the Lord,” and says, “Today this passage is fulfilled in your hearing” (4:19, 21). Jesus presents himself not only as the originator and preserver of the prophetic tradition but also as the long-awaited fulfillment of the prophets’ teachings. I would argue against Furstenberg that Luke does not draw a clear contrast between Law and prophets but instead incorporates Law more subtly, as an element running throughout the narrative that joins together with the prophetic elements to present a vision of God’s justice. This vision finds its illustration in the New Creation, which is the ongoing year of the Lord’s favor, the Year of Jubilee.

In these passages, Jesus draws from the whole body of past prophetic and legal writings as well as competing sectarian arguments that are current in the first century. Following the example of Jesus in these Gospels, Christians may affirm aspects of different institutional powers not only truthfully but also strategically, to accomplish effective critiques and advance visions of how the people of God should be organized. Paul in Acts employs a similar albeit simpler strategy when pitting Pharisees and Sadducees against each other, which allows him to escape punishment by the Sanhedrin (Acts 23). It may behoove members of the Church today to look for analogous opportunities, especially as secularization has not proceeded in a straightforward way—the “decline” narrative—but has given rise to new marketplace of religious beliefs, i.e. competing visions of what constitutes ultimate reality.
