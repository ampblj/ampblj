Among American folk enthusiasts today, whenever one mentions the mandolin, Chris Thile is the household name that comes to mind. In addition to hosting performances on <em>Live From Here</em> (formerly <em>Prairie Home Companion</em>), the virtuoso has advanced the limits of his instrument’s techniques playing in combos across numerous genres and composers, from Bach to Bill Monroe’s bluegrass and Brad Mehldau’s jazz. So, it’s only thanks to the mandolin’s current status as still <em>not</em> a household name, along with pandemic volatility and the fact that Philadelphia is not exactly known as a folk music hub, that a friend (publishing editor Ammar Plumber) and I could score cheap tickets for a performance at Penn. Thile is currently on tour for his first solo album as a singer-songwriter: <em>Laysongs</em> is a work which emblematizes the ironic longing of the contemporary American folk vanguard. Lovers of music and lovers of the Church alike will gain from listening for a dialectic between irony and despair in Thile’s offerings, which invite reflections lingering much longer than the mandolin’s quick note decay.

The intimate concert, on Thursday after the third Sunday of Advent, opened with the almost-title track, “Laysong.” Thile interspersed his soft vocal falsetto with slow bluesy mandolin riffs and some surprisingly pensive foot stomping before stamping out a faster tempo, turning the wooden stage into percussion and shifting to an aggressive chest voice. If I had any doubts whether solo mandolin could properly support a voice, Thile quickly put them to rest. Nevertheless, his arrangement was designed to invite listeners to join in chorus—even if sometimes imaginary given concert hall rules—to augment the mandolin’s sustain.

Even heard for the first time, the melodies raised that thick urge in the throat which comes whenever one prepares to sing along to a familiar tune but can’t. The sensation wasn’t accidental: Thile calls his laysongs “songs of the Church for those outside the Church,” outlets for participating in a post-Christian artistic spirituality. He and his childhood friend bandmates from Nickel Creek grew up singing in church services, learning their techniques at the feet of old timers. Though they lost the faithful content of their craft to fame, they have a love for its form that still speaks to them.

Folk music has been one of the last holdouts of earnestness among the musical genres. Its aural forms, from old-time music to bluegrass hymnody, developed alongside the words of praise in Baptist church halls and Gospel music. The songs bring the playfulness of everyday life to the sacred and sophisticated.

Thile, a master of play, holds worlds within the form. He flowed effortlessly between a Monroe standard and Bach’s sonata in G minor going into a Bartók sonata in the same key, recalling prior Bach projects with Yo-Yo Ma and Edgar Meyer. Folk music also carries a sense of place, and our seats were close enough to see the details of the headstock and the French polish on Thile’s 1924 Gibson Loar F-5 (though not enough to keep track of his blisteringly fast fretting hand)! Proximity inspired appreciation for the aged wood of stage and mandolin, evoking the front porches where the music developed through listening and repeating. Stretches of silence between mandolin fills, thin-sounding on the recorded album, filled the live space with a sense of waiting.

That waiting, the space in the “already but not yet,” balances folk’s complete earnestness with the bite of irony. Those who popularized the music and pioneered its techniques, believers or not, met death and murder with a humor grounded in the hope that the grit of life would make sense within a greater narrative. This ironic balance runs through the songs of the Carter family, e.g. “Keep on the Sunny Side” versus “Worried Man Blues”, in Doc Watson’s picking, and on the genre’s border with country music in Johnny Cash. For their heirs in Thile’s generation, however, the waiting has gone too long, giving way to a despair detectable in the newer technically skilled iterations of “Americana” and “newgrass.” Thile’s Punch Brothers bandmate, the guitarist Chris Eldridge, styles his recordings of “Keep me from Blowing Away” and “Sleeping by Myself” as soft laments of disillusionment. More daring are the words of Sarah Jarosz, the brilliant multi-instrumentalist and Thile’s frequent collaborator: “Well I never really thought that I could be a child of sin,” (“Everything to Hide,” in <em>Undercurrent</em>) and, in her version of James McMurtry’s “Childish Things,” “I don’t believe in Heaven, but I still believe in ghosts.” Thile himself placed the dialectic between irony and despair at the center of his performance with his piece “Salt (in the Wounds) of the Earth.”
	
The piece is a reflection on <em>The Screwtape Letters</em>, C.S. Lewis’s satire of the Devil’s strategies. Like Lewis in his preface, before performing “Salt” for us, Thile added a disclaimer that the persona and words he would express were not his own. Nevertheless, he channeled the diabolical almost too well over the three movements, overlaying expected dissonant chords with stinging indictments of all who have in the words of Matthew’s Gospel “lost their savor”:

>Sweet<br>
Jesus that was close<br>
You really dodged a bullet<br>
Guess everybody knows now<br>
They'd better cut the bullshit<br><br>
'Cause you are the salt of the earth<br>
Renouncing your savor<br>
And they've become the church<br>
Rubbing salt in the wounds of the earth

Thile did not cut a heroic figure like Milton’s Satan, but he had brought in the mischief of Goethe’s Mephistopheles from the moment he entered stage with a leprechaun jump. His posture hunched over the small instrument, whirling his hands flamboyantly, and swaying elliptically from the waist up, he consciously evoked the devil’s shapeshifting skills, switching between improvisations, scale-based mandolin runs, and chop chords to accompany his voice. He even incorporated into his playing four “power chords” of someone’s ringtone that had interrupted the set. I wondered if he hadn’t made a Faustian bargain of soul in exchange for great skill. 

Yet, Thile was reading _Screwtape_ for a reason, looking for an answer to fill the emptied form. He has already tried negation, through the emptiness of further irony, and hedonism. The former produced the evening’s unsuccessful cover of “Don’t Think Twice It’s Alright.” Thile’s glibly ironic treatment of an already ironic song was shallow, turning Dylan’s pathos into an in-joke about sexual undertones. On the other hand, “Ecclesiastes 2:24” and “Dionysus” recalled Thile’s pleasurable process of disillusionment with his self-described teetotaling fundamentalist roots, at the hands of rich old literati and NPR fame, represented by his first glass of wine while on tour in Bordeaux, France. 

Self-referential hedonism, even if shared, isn’t enough to satisfy Thile. The trickster archetype (as Jung characterizes Mephisto and Dionysus), itself a reaction to rigid moral order, points to the need for truth and often prefigures the coming of a savior. Several times in the set, Thile asked us all for answers to his unspoken questions. I would have asked him afterwards what he was looking for had restrictions not been in place.

Still, the hollowed-out form carries memories, the contents of which the Church’s young artists might renew as they improve their technical chops. When Thile returned for an encore, another audience member shouted, “O come, O Come, Emmanuel!” Thile obliged. Somehow, he even remembered a second verse, “O come thou Dayspring, come and cheer our spirits by thine advent here.” No irony could distract from the hope of expecting a baby, good news strummed out on four courses of strings. For just a moment, untouched by the clamor of prestige and fame, all sat listening for the humble birth of God heralded by a mandolin.
