<p>Hi, I’m Frances! I’ve lived in Boston almost my whole life and studied History of Science and Classics at Harvard. I moved to Philadelphia last year and am currently teaching at an all-girls Catholic school while pursing an M.Ed. at Saint Joseph’s University.
<br> <br>
Though I am still trying to figure out God’s plan for me post-fellowship, I am enjoying the time with my girls (who always make life entertaining) while getting to know my new home in Philadelphia, a wacky and lovable city. My days often feel absorbed in the relationships I have with students and friends, so I hope to find a space in <em>Resonant notes</em> to process and reflect on the little moments in life.
