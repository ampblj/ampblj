<p>Welcome to my bio! Iâ€™m Patrick, a Texas native and Philly enthusiast based out of Manhattan. Previously, I studied philosophy and physics at Harvard, where I developed interests in metaphysics, philosophy of science, and everything Thomas Aquinas. (To my great disappointment, I also discovered that none of these interests has a strong job market.) I currently work as a management consultant, but in my free time I enjoy reading and thinking about philosophy and adjacent subjects. I also enjoy baking bread, playing classical piano, and listening to Stevie Wonder.
<br> <br>
Editorially, my main subject areas are philosophy and theology. I also enjoy science writing, particularly on topics that intersect with philosophy, and any writing that brings a new and interesting perspective to a subject.
